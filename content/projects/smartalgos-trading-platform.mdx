# Overview

SmartAlgos is a comprehensive trading and investment suite built for buy-side teams, independent traders, and prop desks that need institutional tooling without institutional overhead. The platform blends high-frequency execution, AI-driven market intelligence, and multi-asset coverage spanning equities, forex, and crypto.

- **AI Intelligence Layer**: TensorFlow- and PyTorch-powered models deliver real-time trade signals, volatility forecasts, and risk scoring across portfolios.
- **Market Center**: Consolidated feeds for NYSE, NASDAQ, and NSE alongside advanced charting and order book depth visualisations.
- **Secure Transactions**: Multi-sig escrow flow, KYC gating, rate limiting, and audit-ready transaction logs keep client capital safe.
- **Desktop Companion**: Electron app with native notifications, streaming tickers, and workspace widgets for always-on monitoring.

## My Role

I led end-to-end solution design—authoring the EA frameworks, scaling the Node.js services, and training the machine learning agents that power analytics. I also produced the documentation, institutional pitch decks, and investor briefs that helped secure early clients.

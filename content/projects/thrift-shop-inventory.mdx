# Overview

The Thrift Shop Inventory Platform is a full-stack solution purpose-built for community-driven retail. It synchronises intake, cataloguing, pricing, and multi-channel sales so donation centres and boutique thrift stores can move inventory quickly without losing track of provenance or valuation.

## Core Features

- **Unified Cataloguing**: Barcode/SKU assignment at intake, with image capture, donor attribution, and condition grading.
- **Real-Time Stock Ledger**: Low-stock alerts, transfer workflows between locations, and automatic status changes when items sell online.
- **Channel Integrations**: REST API hooks out to Shopify, Facebook Marketplace, and internal POS terminals; payment-ready via Stripe.
- **Role-Based Access**: Staff, volunteer, and auditor profiles with granular permissions and activity logs.
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Donation trends, revenue per category, salvage vs retail ratios, and exportable audit packs.

## Assumed Stack

| Layer | Technologies | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | React + Tailwind (deployed on Vercel) | SPA with optimistic UI for speedy stock edits. |
| Backend | Node.js/Express or Vercel serverless functions | Lightweight REST API with webhook automation. |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas or Planetscale | Document store tuned for variant-rich inventory data. |
| Integrations | Stripe payments, barcode scanners, webhook automations | Extensible for donor receipts and fulfilment. |

## Roadmap

- Complete omnichannel order sync and automated donor thank-you workflows.
- Layer in AI-driven price recommendations using historical comps.
- Expand reporting to include ESG impact dashboards for grant-making bodies.

## My Role

I architected the data model, built the Vercel deployment pipeline (over 150 iterations to production), and designed the operator experience so staff can work comfortably from laptops, tablets, or a warehouse kiosk.

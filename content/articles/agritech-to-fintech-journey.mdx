# Bridging Two Worlds

Agricultural extension work taught me how to listen, document, and design programmes for stakeholders with competing priorities. Those skills now power my fintech engineering practice.

## Human-Centred Systems

I unpack how participatory research methods inform the way I conduct discovery workshops for trading desks and fintech startups.

## Data Rigor

We look at how crop modelling experiments inspired the backtesting harnesses I use for SmartAlgos—highlighting the shared DNA between agronomic research and risk modelling.

## Writing as Glue

The through-line is writing: extension manuals yesterday, institutional memos today. Writing keeps teams aligned and accelerates the adoption of complex automation.

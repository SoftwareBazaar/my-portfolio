# Why Blend ML with Deterministic Logic?

Purely deterministic trading systems excel at repeatability, while machine learning agents shine in adaptive environments. The smartest desks combine both. I outline the hybrid architecture we deploy across forex, equities, and crypto desks.

## Environment Design

I share the OpenAI Gym-inspired environment used to simulate exchange microstructure and transaction costs, complete with Redis-backed experience replay.

## Policy Training

We dive into PyTorch policy gradients, reward shaping, and safe exploration when production capital is on the line.

## Deployment

Finally, we discuss how to ship agents into SmartAlgos alongside traditional EAs, complete with guard rails, observability, and human-in-the-loop controls.

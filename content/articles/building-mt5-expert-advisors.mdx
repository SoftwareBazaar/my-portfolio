# Why MT5 Still Matters

MetaTrader 5 remains the connective tissue between retail and institutional order flow. The platform is ubiquitous, programmable, and battle-tested. In this article I walk through the principles I use when designing MT5 expert advisors (EAs) for SmartAlgos clients.

## Regime Detection First

Every EA I ship begins with a volatility and trend-state detector. Without regime awareness, risk control devolves into guesswork. I showcase a TensorFlow Lite model that classifies eight distinct market states with >90% precision.

## Execution with Intent

Order placement is routed through a latency-sensitive Node.js gateway. We discuss how to balance fill quality, slippage tolerance, and broker constraints without overfitting.

## Wrap-Up

I close with testing frameworks, including walk-forward analysis, Monte Carlo scenario testing, and operational checklists before an EA ever touches capital.
